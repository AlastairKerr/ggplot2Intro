# An Introduction to ggplot2 
### Primary audiance:  Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell Biology  
### Created January 2016 

A short (<2 hour) workshop that can be self study or taught. This is aimed at proving a working knowledge of ggplot2 without going into too much depth on specific areas. Only a couple of geometries are covered by design so that more time is available to go over a wider subject area.
